I have learned so much about Data Structures and Algorithms thanks to this genius. 

This is now my attempt to switch to Python. The reason I am doing this is because even though I really like programming in Java 
I feel I am putting myself at a disadvantage for coding interviews. By learning and mastering DSA in Python I will be able to ace coding interviews
while still being able to code side projects in Java.

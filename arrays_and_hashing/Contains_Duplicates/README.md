In this solution you will need a hashset. For each hashset addition, if an item is already present. You will return true. Else return false.

Time complexity is O(n) as the worst case scenario is that the last element in the list of nums is at the end of the list.
Space complexity is O(n) as well as there in the worst case scenario you are creating a HashSet<>() with at the same size as the nums list.
